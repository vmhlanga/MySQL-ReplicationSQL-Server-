# MySQL-Replication to SQL-Server-


My SQL Replication to Microsoft SQL Server

Steps to Take for Code to work

- Create Linked Server Connection over at the sql server you need to replicate data to. 
- Make sure all your tables you need to replicate are not being updated and only transactinal tables.
- Create primary key constraints over at my sql and make sure to use Intergers as ID's. 


Follow the Script and then Rerun . I should post updated script supporting replication on updated rows.
